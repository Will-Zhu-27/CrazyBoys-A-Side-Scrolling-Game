# CrazyBoys-A-Side-Scrolling-Game

CrazyBoys origins from the assignment of COMP30019 Graphics and Interaction of the University of Melbourne, which asks students to use Unity3D to design a game. 

Generally, CrazyBoys is a side scrolling game that the police (player) defeats robbers in the bank building. The idea of this game is inspired by the game [My Friend Pedro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/557340/My_Friend_Pedro/).
